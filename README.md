# Advent of Code 2024 challenge
This December was special in a sense that I managed to come across this interesting version of Advent Calendar.
## Puzzles
- Each day of contains 2 programming puzzles
- All puzzles contain storyline to save Christmas
## Language
### Rust
I noticed this pretty new programming language has been getting more and more popular and I wanted to try it for a while.

So this is me trying to solve some Advent of Code challenges using Rust language.

This is my first time using this language and trying to grasp some problems with it.
